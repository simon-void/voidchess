optimizations:
-is isNotBound easier to compute than !isBound??
-get possibleMoves shouldn't iterate over every reachable move in case of checkLines or boundLines
-a StaticChessBoard with optimized and immutable data structure for StaticEvaluation
-are type checks (e.g. is King) slower that isKing(), isQueen, ... calls?? If not remove those functions
-is there an efficient way to compute if a pawn is a passed pawn?? (because there should be a passed-pawn bonus)

features:
- resizable interface (inclusive full-screen)
- pure chess engine module with 2-way channels (so different engines (written e.g. in Go, Rust, ...) can be used)
